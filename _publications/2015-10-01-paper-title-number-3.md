excerpt: 'Abstract: This article focuses on China’s two waste paper import restriction policies which came into effect respectively in 2018 and 2021 and investigates how they reshaped the global waste paper trade network from 2017 to 2022, before wrapping our study up with a prediction of the international waste paper trade in 2025. Our findings are: First, the second restriction in particular had a negative influence on the overall connectivity of the global waste paper trade network; Second, the two import bans caused the network to exhibit an increasingly modular structure, in which countries in the network tended to form several distinct communities and trade actively only inside their communities; Finally, they resulted in the marginalization of China in the network and the collapse of the trade community once led by China in the network, and the power vacuum that consequently appeared was filled by the rise of other countries, primarily India, the United States, and several European countries.'
