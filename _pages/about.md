I am currently a senior student at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), majoring in English at the Department of Foreign Languages and Literatures. I am also taking courses to obtain minor degrees in __statistics__ as well as __economics__.

I have been admitted to the the University of Chicago's [Master's program in Statistics](https://stat.uchicago.edu/admissions/about-ms/), and I am actively looking for research opportunities.

I have broad interests in tackling problems emerging in fields such as education science, environmental science, and economics using a wide range of statistical and machine learning techniques, particrlarly __network analysis__ and __graph neural networks__. I also have experience in __natural language processing__ as I am working on my undergraduate thesis where I examine the performance of automatic post-editing techniques in the machine translation of English academic texts into Chinese. Moreover, I am working under the supervision of Prof. [Chenyuan Liu](https://www.sem.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1233/6979.htm) at the [School of Economics and Management](https://www.sem.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) of Tsinghua University on topics about insurance plan design and the Chinese medical market.
