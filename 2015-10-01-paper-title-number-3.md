excerpt: 'Abstract: This article investigates how a series of restrictions on solid waste import and export implemented by China influenced the global waste paper trade network (GWPTN) from 2017 to 2022. This paper provides a detailed discussion of the evolutional patterns of different indicators of the GWPTN at the macro-level, meso-level as well as the micro-level. Then, this paper applies the technique of Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to predict how GWPTN will continue to change up to year 2025.'
